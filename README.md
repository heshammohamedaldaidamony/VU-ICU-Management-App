# VU ICU Management App

VU is a graduate project aimed at revolutionizing patient monitoring and healthcare delivery in intensive care units (ICUs). It enhances communication between healthcare teams, automates vital sign monitoring, and provides real-time access to patient data, empowering doctors and nurses to deliver high-quality care efficiently.
### Key Features and Goals
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: Real-time data streaming for continuous patient monitoring.
- :robot: Automated vital sign recording to reduce manual workload and errors.
- :file_folder: Electronic record-keeping for centralized and accessible patient information.
- :satellite: Remote monitoring capabilities to facilitate healthcare provider mobility.
### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Flutter
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Hardware**: ESP32-CAM  
- **Additional Technologies**: Computer vision algorithm

## Planning (Project Beginnings)
To gain a deeper understanding of ICU operations and to gather first-hand insights, we visited several hospitals and interacted with healthcare professionals. These visits were instrumental in shaping our project requirements and understanding the real-world challenges faced by ICU staff :
| Challenge                                      | Solution                                          |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Manual monitoring with potential for errors    | Automated vital sign recording                    |
| Paper-based records hindering communication    | Electronic record-keeping                         |
| Continuous monitoring increased stress         | Remote monitoring Real-time streaming by CAM      |
| Compromised patient care quality               | Enhanced communication and instant notifications  |
#### First Team Meeting and App Sequence (User Journey)
we discussed the challengss and brainstormed potential solutions and visualized our ideas on paper. We created rough sketches of the UI on paper served as the first visual representation of our app, highlighting the essential features and layout.

### The Inspiration Behind "VU"
Befor moving to analysis phase lets see what is behind name "VU".
- "VU" derives from the word "view", emphasizing our focus on providing healthcare providers (doctors and nurses) with a clear view and monitoring capability of patient conditions remotely.
- The characters "V" and "U" resemble peaks often seen in ECG (Electrocardiogram) readings as you see :

## Analysis
During the analysis phase, our team focused on thoroughly understanding the project's requirements and processes : 
#### Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
#### Business Model Exploration
#### Database Analysis and Design
We designed the database schema, ensuring it meets the project requirements. We created both logical and physical Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to represent and relationships between different entities in the system.
